# weather-lookup-tool
- This simple tool uses Python and an API from openweathermap.org to look up basic weather information (e.g., current temperature, humidity, high/low temperature, etc.) using a country code and zip-code. <br>

- This code was based off of/adapted from a YouTube tutorial produced by LeMaster Tech at this link: https://youtu.be/kLNtdehfNrI.
