# weather-lookup-tool

- This simple tool uses Python and an API from openweathermap.org to look up basic weather information (e.g., current temperature, humidity, high/low temperature, etc.) using a country code and zip-code. <br>

- My code is based off of/adapted from a YouTube tutorial produced by LeMaster Tech at this link: https://youtu.be/kLNtdehfNrI.  

- I believe this was a great beginnerâ€™s project for getting started with learning how to use APIs in Python.

- While completing this project, I also learned how to hide API keys using the dotenv Python module and .gitignore/.env files. (See this YouTube video from Jonathan Soma for a good explanation on using the dotenv Python module: https://youtu.be/YdgIWTYQ69A).
